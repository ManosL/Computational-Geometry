Manual:

    In order to compile the program write the following command:

                        make
    
    After that, you can run the executables by typing:

                ./{executable_name}

    If you want to change a parameter in some program, go to
    the respective .cpp file, change the defined parameters
    and recompile again by typing make.

    The executables are the following:

    1. performance_compare: This file runs the experiments that
    we presented on the slides. If you want, you can change some
    parameters.

    2. QuadR-Tree_Perf: This file runs the R-Tree with Quadratic Split 
    for the defined parameters and prints some results about the performance.

    3. RLinear_Perf: This file runs the R-Tree with Linear Split 
    for the defined parameters and prints some results about the performance.

    4. RStar_Perf: This file runs the R*-Tree for the defined
    parameters and prints some results about the performance.
