Manual

    In order to run the exercises you should type on the terminal
    the command 

        sage {.sage file path}
    
    or probably you can run the automatically produced by sage 
    python scripts. We wrote the programs on sage because we had
    problem at importing the sage library into a python file, so
    we found that alternative.

    In exercises 3 and 4, two pictures getting created. The 
    ex{exercise num}_random_points.png are the random points
    that we will give as input to the algorithm and 
    ex{exercise num}_ch2.png is the resulting convex hull.
